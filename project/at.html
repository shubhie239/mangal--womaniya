			<h3>Anuradha TK</h3>
			<p>Anuradha TK is one dynamic woman who not only debunked myths surrounding women’s lack of inclination towards fields related to science but also risen to the topmost position of India’s space agency. She joined ISRO in 1982 and has been working since then. Anuradha is now the seniormost woman scientist at ISRO.</p>

			<p><br><b>The First Woman Scientist at ISRO</b><br>
<br>For this senior-most woman officer at Isro, the sky is the limit - she specialises in sending communication satellites into space that sit at least 36,000km from the earth's centre.

The scientist who has worked with Isro for the past 34 years first thought about space when she was nine.</p>

<p><br><i>"It was the Apollo launch, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. We had no television in those days, so I heard about it from my parents and teachers. It really ignited the imagination. I wrote a poem on a man landing on the moon in Kannada, my native language."</i><p>

<p><br><b>Role Model to so many</b><br>
<br>Considered a role model by other women scientists at Isro, Ms Anuradha disagrees that women and science don't gel.

<br><br><i>"I never liked subjects where I needed to remember a lot and science looked logical to me. I don't believe that Indian girls think science is not meant for them and I think maths is their favourite subject."</i><br></p>
			<p><br><b>Equality at ISRO</b><br>
<br>When she joined Isro in 1982, there were only a few women and even fewer in its engineering department.

"In my batch, five-six women engineers joined Isro. We stood out and everyone knew us. Today, more than 20-25% of Isro's over 16,000 employees are women and we no longer feel special," she laughs.

At Isro, she says, gender is not an issue and the recruitment and promotional policies are all dependent on "what we know and what we contribute".

<br><br><i>"Sometimes I say that I forget that I'm a woman here. You don't get any special treatment because you're a woman, you're also not discriminated against because you're a woman. You're treated as an equal here."</i>

<br><br>She laughs at the suggestion that her colleagues consider her an inspiration, but agrees that having more women in workplace can be a motivating factor for other women.

<i>"Once girls see that there are lots of women in the space programme, they also get motivated, they think if she can do it, so can they."</i></p>
			<p><br>Although the numbers of women staff has been consistently growing at Isro, it is still way below the halfway mark.

That's because "we are still carrying cultural loads on our backs and many women think their priorities lie elsewhere, at home", she says.</p>

<p><b><br>Advice to Upcoming Women Scientists</b><br>
<br>Her advice to women who want to be rocket scientists is simple: "make arrangements".

<i>"Once I had made up my mind that I needed a purposeful career where my passion lay, I created a good set up at home. My husband and my parents-in-law were always cooperative, so I didn't have to worry much about my children.<br><br>

And I owe my success to the arrangements I made. You have to give something to get something. But life is like that. So when there was work to do, when I was needed at the office, I was here, working with passion. And when there was an absolute need for me to be at home, I was there."</i></p>
