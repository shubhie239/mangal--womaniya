			<h1>MANGAL WOMANIYA</h1>
			<p><br>          Mangalyaan, India's maiden mission to Mars launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO), was a significant step in furthering the country's space ambitions. It not only made India the fourth country to successfully place a satellite into the orbit of the red planet, but also made ISRO the first space organisation to achieve the feat in it's first attempt.</p>
			<p><br>          The mission had a team of about 500 people working to make it a success, but a major driving force behind the mission were the women. <b>About 27 percent of the key executive positions in the mission were held by women.</b></p>
			<p><br>          Of this power-packed bunch, <b>Ritu Karidhal, Nandini Harinath, Anuradha TK, Moumita Dutta</b> and <b>Minal Rohit</b> were some of the women who played a crucial role.</p>
