			<h3>Ritu Karidhal</h3>
			<p><br>An aerospace engineer who aimed for the stars and reached Mars and the Moon.</p>

			<p><br><i>“I have always had a fascination for mysteries of outer space, and knew that’s what I wanted to get into”</i> — Ritu Karidhal</p>
			<p><br>Ritu Karidhal, an aerospace engineer who works at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), has been an integral figure for India’s space exploration.</p>
			<p><br><b>Deputy Operations Director</b><br>
<br>When Ritu started at ISRO in Bangalore, she started off posted at the U. R. Rao Satellite Centre (URSC). The most challenging project that landed on her desk was India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (M.O.M), named Mangalyaan-1. In 2012, Ritu was appointed as the Deputy Operations Director on the mission: a mission that had a short completion time and was the first interplanetary one for India. Ritu played a key role in creating the craft’s autonomy system; calling it the “brain of the satellite”.<br><br> Due to the distance of travel, the complexity of sending and receiving signals would amount to ~40 mins per signal. Thus, Ritu headed a team creating a software system designed to make decisions on its own. In collaboration with a team of scientists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, the autonomy system was created in a record 10 months!</p>
			<p><br>The project was completed in a mere 18 months and is the most economical interplanetary project to date. Mangalyaan-1 was launched on 5th November 2013, and has been successfully orbiting Mars since 24th September 2014. This was the first time any country had reached the Mars orbit in their first attempt. The celebratory picture of a number of women scientists who worked on the mission was shared worldwide! Ritu, along with a number of other women on the team at ISRO, landed the title of “Rocket Women of India”.</p>
			<p><br><b>Post Mangalyaan</b><br>
			<br>While Mangalyaan-1 was a massive success for ISRO, India, and space science, another important accomplishment it highlighted was that scientists, regardless of gender, worked together to make it a success, breaking the gender stereotypes! “M.O.M” not only was a mission, but also the description of an integral part of the team. Ritu recalls the difficulties of balancing personal and professional life. With the M.O.M project, all of a sudden her schedule was busier than normal, so much so that after leaving work, helping her kids with homework, she continued to do work from midnight to 4 am.</p>
			<p><br><b>Ritu's take on MOM's success</b><br>
<br><i>“Mental endurance takes over physical strength. I went without sleep for two to three days because I did not want to miss anything. And it was only after the launch and excitement was over that the waves of exhaustion come crashing over me”</i> — Ritu Karidhal</p>
			<p><br>Mangalyaan-1 had all of India’s eyes on it. And after the successful launch and orbiting, Ritu became an overnight celebrity, invited to speak at multiple TEDx Talks and colleges, giving interviews to journalists for newspapers and TV across the country. A young girl who collected clippings of space-related news grew up to become one of India’s most sought after space scientist!</p>
